# Genetic Algorithm with Python and MATLAB

This repository contains implementations of genetic algorithm (GA) optimization techniques using both Python and MATLAB. Genetic algorithms are optimization algorithms that simulate the process of natural selection to find the best solution to a given problem.

## Overview

The Genetic Algorithm with Python and MATLAB repository provides a set of examples and tools for applying genetic algorithms to a wide range of optimization problems. The repository contains examples of genetic algorithms applied to problems such as feature selection, parameter tuning, and function optimization.

The repository is divided into two directories: `python` and `matlab`. Each directory contains examples and tools for applying genetic algorithms using the respective programming language.

## Contents

The contents includes:
- Matlab Implementation for Multi-Objective Genetic Functions
- Python Implementation for Single and Multi-Objective Functions

## Requirements

To run the examples in this repository, you will need to have Python (version 3.7 or higher) and/or MATLAB installed on your machine.

For the Python examples, you will also need to have the `numpy` and `scikit-learn` libraries installed.

## Usage

To run the examples in this repository, you can clone the repository to your local machine and then navigate to the directory for the programming language you are interested in (`python` or `matlab`). From there, you can run the corresponding script(s) for the example(s) you are interested in.

Each script may also contain additional instructions for running the example or setting up any necessary environment variables or configuration files.

## Contributing

This repository is intended to be a starting point for exploring genetic algorithms in Python and MATLAB. Contributions and suggestions for improvement are always welcome. If you have an idea for an example or tool that you would like to see added to the repository, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
